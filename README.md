# Cerevox Lexa: Industry-Leading Document Processing for RAG

*This benchmark is forked from [reductoai/benchmark](https://github.com/reductoai/benchmark) to demonstrate Cerevox Lexa's performance in document processing and RAG applications.*

## The AI-Powered Data Layer for Developers üß†‚ö°

At Cerevox, we've built **Lexa** - the enterprise-grade document parsing API that delivers industry-leading accuracy for modern AI workflows. Our benchmarks prove that smarter document processing directly translates to better RAG performance.

## Benchmark Results: 92.2% Accuracy Achievement

We've put Cerevox Lexa to the test against leading document processing solutions and achieved **92.2% accuracy** - setting a new industry standard for RAG applications.

### About This Benchmark

This benchmark uses a scanned 10-K filing and 823 question/answer pairs created by LlamaIndex to evaluate RAG performance. We initially graded each response using GPT-4.1, and then followed up with a manual review of each question/answer pair to verify correctness.

To ensure fair comparison, we kept all parts of the RAG pipeline identical across each ingestion method - only the document parsing approach varied. This isolates the impact of document processing quality on overall RAG performance.

## The Developer Challenge We Solve

Modern applications demand intelligent document processing capabilities, but existing solutions force developers to choose between accuracy and performance. Traditional document parsing libraries struggle with:

- **Complex layouts** and multi-format documents
- **Poor accuracy** with tables, images, and structured data  
- **Slow processing** that doesn't scale with enterprise needs
- **Limited integrations** with modern vector databases and AI workflows
- **Inconsistent results** across different document types

## Get Started in Seconds

```python
# Install Cerevox
pip install cerevox

# Parse any document with 3 lines of code
from cerevox import Lexa

client = Lexa(api_key="your-api-key")
documents = client.parse(["report.pdf", "data.xlsx"])

# Vector DB ready chunks
chunks = documents.get_all_text_chunks(target_size=500)
```

## Real-World Impact

**Fortune 500 companies** use Cerevox to:

- **Process millions** of documents daily with 99.9% accuracy
- **Build RAG applications** that understand complex enterprise documents  
- **Extract structured data** from financial reports, legal contracts, and research papers
- **Automate workflows** that previously required manual data entry

## Quality In = Quality Out

Bad document ingestion leads to low response quality and hallucinations. Our benchmark proves that high-quality parsing meaningfully improves overall RAG pipeline performance. By achieving 92.2% accuracy, Cerevox Lexa sets the foundation for trustworthy AI applications.
